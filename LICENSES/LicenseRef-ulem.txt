%  The ulem package provides various types of underlining that can stretch
%  between words and be broken across lines in LaTeX or plain TeX.
%  In LaTeX ulem replaces italics with underlining in \em-phasized text.
%  It is most suitable for simple text such as {\em ibid.} or \emph{\LaTeX:
%  A Document Preparation System} that may need to be underlined in a
%  manuscript submitted for publication.  A declaration of \normalem (or
%  the \usepackage option "normalem") restores the normal \em behavior.
%
%  Full instructions appear in ulem.ltx (ulem.pdf).  In summary:
%
%    \uline{important}   underlined text
%    \uuline{urgent}     double-underlined text
%    \uwave{boat}        wavy underline
%    \sout{wrong}        line drawn through word
%    \xout{removed}      marked over with //////.
%    \dashuline{dashing} dash underline
%    \dotuline{dotty}    dotted underline
%
%    {\em phasized\/}  | In LaTeX, by default, these are underlined; use
%    \emph{asized}     | \normalem or [normalem] to restore italics
%    \useunder{\uwave}{\bfseries}{\textbf}
%                        use wavy underline in place of bold face
%    Use \markoverwith for defining new types of underlining.
