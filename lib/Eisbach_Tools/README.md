# Eisbach and Tactic Tools

This session contains tools and tactics for defining Isabelle [Eisbach] methods.

Some of the theories in this session are not strictly speaking Eisbach-related,
but are mostly used from Eisbach methods, so we collect them here as well.

We only include theories that are needed in the [Monads], [CParser], and
[AutoCorres] sessions.

[Monads]: ../Monads/
[CParser]: ../../tools/c-parser/
[AutoCorres]: ../../tools/autocorres/
