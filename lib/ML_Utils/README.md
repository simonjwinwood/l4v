# Isabelle/ML Utilities

`ML_Utils` is a collection of 'basic' ML utilities (similar to
`~~/src/Pure/library.ML`}). If you find yourself implementing:

- a simple data-structure-shuffling task,
- something that shows up in the standard library of other functional languages, or
- something that's "missing" from the general pattern of an Isabelle ML library,

consider adding it here.
