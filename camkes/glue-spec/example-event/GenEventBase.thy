  This section provides an example following on from \autoref{h:procbase} that
  gives an example of the corresponding definitions that are generated for a
  system involving \camkes events. A system defined by the following
  specification will be used throughout:

text \<open>
  The data types generated for a system involving events are similar to those
  for a system involving procedures, however an additional instance is
  derived for every
  connection in the system that carries event messages.
  This generated instance models the state of the event;
  that is, whether it is pending or not.

subsubsection \<open>\label{sssec:eventbaseprim}Interface Primitives\<close>
text \<open>
  For each component type with a @{term consumes} interface, two primitives are
  generated for each interface. These correspond to the wait and poll functions
  in generated glue code. As for procedures, @{term embed} functions must be
  supplied by the user to save the result of the operation into the component's
  local state.

  Event callbacks are not currently represented. These can be represented by
  hand in the intermediate user theory. We plan to extend the generator in
  future to wrap this functionality in a primitive for the user.

  For each component type with an @{term emits} interface, a single primitive is
  generated to correpond to the emit function in the glue code. The emit
  definition needs no embedding or projection functions because it is
  state-independent.

subsubsection \<open>\label{sssec:eventbaseinst}Instantiations of Primitives\<close>
text \<open>
  As for procedure interfaces, the event primitives are specialised for each
  interface in the system by partially applying them with a function mapping
  the interface to the relevant -- in this case the only -- system connection.
